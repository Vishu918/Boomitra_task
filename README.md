## Farm Field Health Monitoring using Satellite Data (NDVI Calculation)
This repository contains a Python workflow to help farmers monitor the health of their fields in adverse weather conditions using satellite data. The workflow calculates the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) based on Sentinel 2 Imagery. NDVI is a crucial indicator of plant health, allowing farmers to identify stressed areas in their fields and take necessary measures to ensure optimal yield.
